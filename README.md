# ACloudGuruPowerUser
Enhanced UX controls for A Cloud Guru power users

This Chrome extension will allow you to use keyboard shortcuts to toggle play/pause and skip forward/back when watching video courses on A Cloud Guru, even when the video element is not in focus. This is very useful if you want to minimise how much you need to use the mouse, especially when quickly switching to a note keeping app then back to the video via keyboard (e.g. using alt + tab).

Available shortcuts:
- Space: toggle play/pause
- Right arrow: skip forward 10 seconds
- Left arrow: skip back 10 seconds

## Installation instructions:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
2. Turn on Developer Mode (top right corner)
3. Click on **Load unpacked**
4. Navigate to the `src` folder and click OK

You will now be able to use the extension on any page that starts with `https://learn.acloud.guru/`
